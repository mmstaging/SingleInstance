/// Guidelines:
///
/// - Use Singleton pattern to share a Utility object
/// - Use SingleInstance pattern for non-shared objects (esp. dependency injection)
/// - Parent object should have at least same lifespan as SingleInstance and hold strong reference throughout. References at injection site should be `unowned` to call out that these values are injected.
///
/// Unlike Singletons which are lazily initialized and shared, the lifecycle of SingleInstances
/// are explicit in the code and few lines of code should have access to the object, reducing
/// potential down-the-line technical debt when original coders are replaced, and also providing
/// a clean state for each test case, since the Singleton's typically do not deinitialize.
